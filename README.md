### üìä Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis (2009‚Äì2012)
## üè¢ Project Overview

This project focuses on a real-world business intelligence case study for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) ‚Äî a Lagos-based company specializing in office supplies and furniture. The company serves various customer segments, including individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale).

As part of a Business Intelligence initiative, I was engaged to support the Abuja division by analyzing historical sales and order data from 2009 to 2012, which was provided in Excel format. This analysis forms part of the DSA Data Analysis SQL Capstone Case Studies.

## Case Objectives
Using SQL, I explored key performance metrics to support data-driven decision-making for KMS. The analysis is structured around two scenarios:
