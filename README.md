### 📊 Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis (2009–2012)
## 🏢 Project Overview

This project focuses on a real-world business intelligence case study for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) — a Lagos-based company specializing in office supplies and furniture. The company serves various customer segments, including individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale).
